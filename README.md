# My Python, Our Python
This is a complete repository where my Python files can be found, ranging from me as a beginner to a pro programmer. 

## Projects 

## [TIME.py](https://github.com/imboowa/Python/blob/main/TIME.py)
This project prints time in seconds\:minutes:hours\:days:weeks. It basically taught me as a beginner that loops are really powerful, time module, type casting, the modulus operator, and how to format strings in f-strings. I really gained lots of skills in this code as a beginner.

## [bubble.py](https://github.com/imboowa/Python/blob/main/bubble.py)
This is a nice algorithm for beginners and I was a beginner, I took mush logic and deep thinking from this project of swapping values if greater than. I also learnt how variables store data, multiple assignment `assigning many 'n' number of values to 'n' number of variables`, and functions.

## [selection.py](https://github.com/imboowa/Python/blob/main/selection.py)
This is like bubble sort but it has optimizations that kind of reduces swaps. I really thought it hard but later as you learnt it, it seems magic. I see ehy algorithms are needed in life, they simplify life and make programming logical. 

## [core.py](https://github.com/imboowa/Python/blob/main/core.py)
Well, algorithms are essential in programming. This one helps determine if a number entered is credit cardy or not. It takes in numbers and iterate through odd `suming them up` and iterates through even `multiplying each by 2`. Then sum even and odd. We lastly check if sum is divisible by 10 `must no reminder`.

## [linear.py](https://github.com/imboowa/Python/blob/main/linear.py)
I have tried machine learning since it is an essential algorithm in life and cyber age. Well, I have linear regression in my hand and multiple linear regression. I love to understand the concept rather than master the emerging libraries hence when something breaks, I am in to fix but not code. It is kind of a Math teacher, he teaches you the algorithm but doesn't code it but he can fix them problem when he looks through your debugger.

## [multiple.py](https://github.com/imboowa/Python/blob/main/multiple.py)
This one is more like linear regression but more inputs are involved it like previously we had `y = mx + b` but here we have `y = (m1 * w1) + (m2 * w2) + ... (mn * wn) + b`. So multiple inputs give it the name multiple linear regression. I really love discovering algorithms because they are logical, simple, and fast.
