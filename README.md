# My Python, Our Python

This is a complete repository where my Python files can be found, ranging from me as a beginner to a pro programmer. 

## Projects 
# [TIME.py](https://github.com/imboowa/Python/blob/main/TIME.py)
This project prints time in seconds\:minutes:hours\:days:weeks. It basically taught me as a beginner that loops are really powerful, time module, type casting, the modulus operator, and how to format strings in f-strings. I really gained lots of skills in this code as a beginner.

# [bubble.py](https://github.com/imboowa/Python/blob/main/bubble.py)
This is a nice algorithm for beginners and I was a beginner, I took mush logic and deep thinking from this project of swapping values if greater than. I also learnt how variables store data, multiple assignment `assigning many 'n' number of values to 'n' number of variables`, and functions.

# [selection.py](https://github.com/imboowa/Python/blob/main/selection.py)
This is like bubble sort but it has optimizations that kind of reduces swaps. I really thought it hard but later as you learnt it, it seems magic. I see ehy algorithms are needed in life, they simplify life and make programming logical. 

# [core.py](https://github.com/imboowa/Python/blob/main/core.py)
Well, algorithms are essential in programming. This one helps determine if a number entered is credit cardy or not. It takes in numbers and iterate through odd `suming them up` and iterates through even `multiplying each by 2`. Then sum even and odd. We lastly check if sum is divisible by 10 `must no reminder`.
